  A browser-based visual editor for designing encounters in ONB<br>
</p>

## Getting Started

To use the editor, visit https://indianajson.github.io/visual-encounters/ to use the editor. While you can import existing configs, they can only contain encounter configurations and the return string (no functions, comments, etc) so you are better off creating new configurations with the tool and then importing those if you wish to change them later. 
</p><p align="justify">
The editor's interface has three main sections: main menu (at top), battle preview (in middle), and settings (at bottom). To change the settings for any given tile simply click on the tile to select it and the menu options will change at the bottom.  To edit the encounter's main settings (such as music file, callback function, freedom mission settings, etc) unselect the currently selected tile by clicking on it again.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>: This editor modifies and creates configuration files compatible specifically with <a href="https://github.com/Keristero/ezlibs-scripts#ezencounters">Keristero's ezEncounters library</a> you will need to set up ezLibs on your server in order for the configuration files made with this tool to function. This editor does NOT supply the mods so if you use something outside of ezEncounter's defaults you will need to download it from <a href="https://keristero.github.io/onb-modsite/">the mod site</a> and add it your server.  </p>


## Features

- Changes are saved every time in your browser so you can close the page and come back later without losing your progress (does not work in Incognito/Private browsing sessions).
- Multiple encounters per configuration file.
- Settings (music, freedom missions, callback functions) are definable within the editor. 
- Allows for multiple players on field for PVP and coop encounters.

## Known Limitations

- Importing works well IF the lua only contains encounter variables and a return (other functions, comments, etc. break the importer).
- Each encounter can only have one table for positions so you have to make separate variations if you want different mob placement.
- Virus list is restricted to ezEncounters default viruses and the preview doesnâ€™t change for each virus rank (only a preview image for the main virus). The virus list is also hard coded at the moment where (in a perfect work) it would be based on current mob mod list.
