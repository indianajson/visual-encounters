  A browser-based visual editor for designing encounters in ONB<br>
</p>

## Getting Started

This editor modifies and creates configuration files compatible with [Keristero's ezEncounters library](https://github.com/Keristero/ezlibs-scripts#ezencounters) you will need to setup ezLibs on your server in order for the configuration files made with this tool to work. 

To use the editor, visit http://indianajson.github.io/visual-encounters/ to use the editor. While you can import existing configs, they can only contain encounter configurations and the return string (no functions, comments, etc) so you are better off creating new configurations with the tool and then importing those if you wish to change them.

- All settings (music, freedom missions, callback functions) are definable within the editor.
